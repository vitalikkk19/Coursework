Comparison of efficiency of classes of steganographic algorithms

-------------
Steganography is a science that studies methods and algorithms to protect information by concealing the fact of their existence and it is based on different principles.

The principles of crypto security and classification of steganography were described in this work. The task and mathematical formulation of steganography were formulated. Also different algorithms of informational protection in multimedia data were described and compared their efficiency. The classification of attacks on stegosystems was also specified. The methods of hiding information in the BMP format by the least significant bit method and in the JPG format by the Koch-Zhao method are analyzed in more detail.

Using the software implementation (Python programming language) of the algorithm for hiding (and extracting data) by replacing the least significant bit, when choosing a container BMP format, you can note a fairly good image quality after modification. Also with the help of software implementation it was possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the method at the pixel level. You can see that  the image quality decreases with the size of the built-in message by calculating the «noise/signal» ratio, the root mean square error and using an online resource to graphically display the difference between the images.
